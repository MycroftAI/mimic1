PCRE was successfully compiled. However, it could not be installed.
The most likely cause is a lack of permissions. This script will try to run
the installation with sudo asking your password.

The installation failed. Please run this or check other possible errors:

In case you do not have admin permissions you can install everything to a custom
directory by running dependencies.sh with --prefix="/a/writable/directory"
